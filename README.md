# Welcome
Hi! In this repo I've attached some of my work as I've been learning ElectronJS and how to use it. 
I've been working on a few projects in my free time and having an interface for smooth interaction would make my projects feel more elegant.

Also, I feel like it would be pretty cool to learn how to make a desktop interface so that's another motivation for learning this.

# How I'm learning it
So far, I've been looking at some YT tutorials and the official ElectronJS website to try and learn the features and how to use the software.
After going through these sources, I'm hoping to create my own personal interface for the F1 WDC project I have which should be in another one of my repos.

# What I've been looking at/Tutorials:
* Official ElectronJS website Tutorial: https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-prerequisites
* Codevolution ElectronJS Tutorial Series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwiCJD3WrAFUrIMkGVDE0uqW


# How it's been:
* 05/19/25 - Had some issues setting up Github, so lost about an hour or two's work. Finished setting up Github repo, will start working on tutorial content later.
  
* 05/21/25 - Created this README and devlog, plan to keep track of progress.
  * Fixed .gitignore issue, my file was using the wrong UTF encoding.
